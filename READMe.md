Pokemon API Challenge

Peer Review: By Xavier Hopkins - Halley's site looks really good! Her search bar and favorites both work properly, and the colors match the overall asthetic of the website. Adding the pokeball for the site icon was a nice touch as well. Overall great job on the assignment!

Descriptions: 
- 1/29: Installed tailwind. Designed the layout. Fetched APIs and got it to show up on the console.
- 1/30: Search/ Input field to work and started on the favorites page/drawer. Got Abilities, Moves, Name, and Location to display.
- 1/31: Evolution path logic. Got the randomize button to work and display its data. Fixed heart button where if they search another pokemon, it won't always stay filled out.
- 2/1: Stylized Favorites drawer, responsiveness, finished evolution path logic. Created a function to display a pokemon at the start.
